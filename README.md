## Project Overview

The frontend of the AI Study Assistant is designed to give students a clean, simple, and easy way to interact with the system. Through this interface, users can upload their study materials in formats like PDF, DOCX, or TXT, and view the summaries and quizzes generated by the AI. The dashboard makes it easy to keep track of uploaded files, check quiz results, and monitor progress over time. The goal is to make studying more organized and engaging by providing a responsive and user-friendly experience that helps students focus on learning rather than managing their notes.
